# Understanding Data with Visualization

I have displayed a few data visualization mainly using Tableau and Flourish based on public datasets. You can find each Tableau Workbook within the "Workbook" directory in this repo. Feel free to check out images of the dashboards below, and download any workbook that interests you. I also included SQL queries to wrangle the data into the correct representation.

# Animate a data story with Flourish

In this [animate story ](https://public.flourish.studio/story/566092/) created by Flourish, we visualized the relationship between GDP changes and carbon emissions in countries with different development levels from 1990 to 2014. And we have following founding from visualization: From 1994 to 2014, developing countries achieved 100% economic growth at the cost of 50% increase in Co2 emissions and developed countries successfully raised GDP at 130% and decrease 29% Co2 emissions.

## Flights Delay Dashboard

<iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/FlightsDelayAnalysis/delayamongairlines?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true"  width="1100" height="800"></iframe>


This is a story created by Tableau. Three parts of the story dipict insights I refined from dataset. Topics included:
- Airports in south and west of U.S. is more likely to have a high delay and vice versa.
- Arilines have significant difference delay time, Spirit Air Lines has most delay and Alaska Airlines has least delay. However, the huge standard variance of delay time in each airline implies the average delay time is not a strong reference of expect delay time based on airlines.
- Weekend has more delay than weekdays in December, January and February. And weekend has less delay than weekdays in September. . The rest of months they have similiar delay time to each other.
